# xray-logger & xray-logger-agent
Parsing &amp; sending xray logs from nodes to the database for analysis (malware, torrents, etc.)

It works as a client-server. The client (xray-logger-agent) scans the logs and sends them in batches to the server (xray-logger). The server receives the data and writes it to the database.

The client and server can work both via http (by IP address) so it is via https (via domain). Even when working over http, **the data is encrypted with aes-256-gcm.**

1. If you want to configure work via *http + IP*, do not forget to add a port at the end of the IP address during the configuration of the client agent. **By default: 8080**.
2. If you want to set up work via *https + domain*, **prepare a proxy server**. 
3. You also need to **prepare a proxy server for working with Adminer** (this is mandatory).

*Tested and works with **Marzban** and **Remna** panels*

# Installation

## xray-logger (server)

### Run the script on the server:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likstanov/xray-logger/refs/heads/main/start-xray-logger.sh | sudo bash
```

After executing the script, **copy the secret encryption** key (you will need it when installing the agent client) and also do not forget to **copy the password for the Adminer panel**.

## xray-logger-agent (client)

### Run the script on the node:
```
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/likstanov/xray-logger/refs/heads/main/start-xray-logger-agent.sh | sudo bash -s --
```

Prepare yourself before running the script. It will ask you to enter **the secret encryption key** (for communication between the client and the server), **the path to the log file** and **the name of the log file**, **the server address** (xray-logger server),  and **the name of the node** from which the logs are sent.

## Additional settings

### xray-logger (server) settings

You can configure the server by editing the **/opt/xray-logger/.env** (by default, everything will work out of the box if you installed the application using the script from this guide).

```
# xray-logger (server) .env example
PORT=8080

# true if nginx/Cloudflare is behind the server and you need a client IP from X-Forwarded-For.
# On the proxy server, you need to transmit the client's address in the stub:
# proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
# proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
TRUST_PROXY=false

# secret code generated using openssl rand -base64 32 (it must be the same on the server and the client)

### xray-logger-agent (client) settings

You can configure the client by editing the **/opt/xray-logger/agent/.env** file (by default, everything will work out of the box if you installed the application through the script from this guide).

```
